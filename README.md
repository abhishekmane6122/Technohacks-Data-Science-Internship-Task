# Task 1: House Price Prediction 
Use a dataset that includes information about
housing prices and features like square
footage, number of bedrooms, etc. to train a
model that can predict the price of a new
house

Datasets : ![House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices in King County, USA, using a diverse set of features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. We employed a Random Forest Regression model to analyze and forecast house prices, providing a valuable tool for homebuyers and real estate professionals.
