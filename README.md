# Task 1: House Price Prediction 
Use a dataset that includes information about
housing prices and features like square
footage, number of bedrooms, etc. to train a
model that can predict the price of a new
house

**Datasets:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices in King County, USA, using a diverse set of features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. We employed a Random Forest Regression model to analyze and forecast house prices, providing a valuable tool for homebuyers and real estate professionals.

# Task 2: Social media sentiment analysis 
Use a dataset of tweets or Facebook posts and
perform sentiment analysis to determine the
the overall sentiment of the posts.

**Datasets**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment

## Overview

Social Media Sentiment Analysis is a powerful tool designed to analyze the sentiment expressed in social media posts, including tweets related to airline travel. This project is built on cutting-edge natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, providing valuable insights into public sentiment towards airlines.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the overall sentiment of social media posts, categorizing them as 'positive,' 'neutral,' or 'negative.'
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text data to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.
- **Multiple Models**: Train and evaluate sentiment analysis models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
- **Text Vectorization**: Utilize various text vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF and Count Vectorization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculate and visualize key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and more.

![Employee Attrition](https://pdancel.github.io/img/portfolio/Employee.png)
# Task 3 : : Employee turnover prediction
# Employee Attrition Prediction

Predicting employee attrition is a crucial task for HR and organizations to retain valuable talent and optimize workforce planning. This project focuses on using machine learning to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company based on various attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a synthetic HR dataset designed for educational purposes. It contains information about fictional employees and attributes that can be used for analysis and predictive modeling. The dataset includes features such as age, education level, job role, salary, and more.
